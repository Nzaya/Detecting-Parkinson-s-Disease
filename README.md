# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease

What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

Objective
To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

Model Used:
 a.) XGBOOST Classifier
 XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library
