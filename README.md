# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease

## What is Parkinson’s Disease?

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

## Objective

To build a model to **accurately** detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

## Model Used:
1. XGBOOST Classifier
    - XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library
